# Tutor Application

The purpose of this project is to create an application that connects UMO students with tutors, and to facilitate the scheduling of tutoring sessions and assignments


## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

Editing and running tutor-app requires

NodeJS: https://nodejs.org/en/download/

React: https://reactjs.org/

and a code editor of your choice. The documents in the main folder can be opened using Microsoft Word and Excel, or any program that can import .docx and .xlsx files

mobx: 
Navigate to the repository, and run 'npm install mobx --save'
Then run 'npm install mobx-react --save'

navigate to the repository, and run 'npm install react-bootstrap bootstrap'

react-select:
navigate to the repository, and run 'npm i --save react-select'

user-event:

##Running the App
The website can be run by opening your system's command line and entering

'cd (directory of tutor-app folder)'

This will start the react server and open the website in your default web browser

Alternatively, Windows users can quickly start the website by running the "start.bat" file in the tutor-app folder
