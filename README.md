# Tutor Application

The purpose of this project is to create an application that connects UMO students with tutors, and to facilitate the scheduling of tutoring sessions and assignments


## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

Editing and running tutor-app requires

NodeJS: https://nodejs.org/en/download/

React: https://reactjs.org/

and a code editor of your choice. The documents in the main folder can be opened using Microsoft Word and Excel, or any program that can import .docx and .xlsx files

mobx: 
Navigate to the repository, and run 'npm install mobx --save'
Then run 'npm install mobx-react --save'

## Running Tests

The website can be tested by opening your system's command line, and entering

'cd (directory of tutor-app folder)'

'npm start'

This will start the react sever and open the website in your default web browser
